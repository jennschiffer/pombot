## Update Dec 15 2019 - hey users of pombot, you probably noticed the bot going down and that's because i need to move it to a server not owned by my former employer. i'm sorry for the inconvenience - as i haven't touched the bot in a few years and i've been busy at [glitch](https://glitch.com), i am going to need some time over the holiday week to get things running elsewhere. my goal is to have things running before the new year.
